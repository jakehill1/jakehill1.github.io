<p>Mobile-enabled and cloud-based omnichannel platform to speed up innovation and business change for midsize to large retail and restaurant businesses. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Nobly POS is the #1 customer-rated iPad Point of Sale for restaurants. Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. ShopKeep helps you keep track of your store inventory with no limit on the number of managed items and with reporting that goes down to the ingredient.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

<p>Advanced features of KORONA's automation and retail inventory management helps you identify and resolve problems to improve business operations. 1. Unfortunately the actual types of POS software available can be very limited, but this all depends on exactly what sort of retail business it is the person owns. It incorporates barcode, scanning, credit card swipes, inventory scanning and so on. It also helps in handling accounts payable, accounts receivables, customer information, and supplier information etc.</p>
<p>Yet we try to make their lives simple and easy with the retail Point of sales software. Mobile ordering and handheld processing devices are the latest trend, giving you the flexibility to move around the store, offering customers a more personal experience, and freeing up congestion at the checkout counter. The Lightspeed Point of Sale system is also listed among the top POS systems with its amazing set of features and high-level performance.</p>

We work together with you to understand your business and find the best POS system for your restaurant — one that will offer the best time and money saving features, allowing you to focus on what is important: keeping your customers happy.

<p>Lightspeed is a cloud-based Point of Sales (POS) and eCommerce solution. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. Opt for the Revel Advantage plan, and payments can be processed for a flat fee through Revel for an EMV-ready, Apple Pay-ready, all-cards-accepted service.</p>
<p>The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. In order to open a customer tab, the bartender only needs to swipe the customer's card through the system. Square for Restaurants is particularly suited for basic quick-service coffee shops, food trucks, cafés, bars, etc. As well, retailers can offer special promotions and customer loyalty programs to promote customer loyalty and product branding.</p>
<p>Rezku's team is staffed with experts in restaurant management technology that want you to succeed. Beyond food and order management, Lightspeed lets you create and implement employee schedules while monitoring work performance. The POS software installed in the computers of a retail business store also enables the businesses to accept and record cash flow and payments and make sure that the products are always stocked.</p>

Square Point of Sale, our pick for best overall POS system, has an excellent all-in-one solution for taking payments through stationary or mobile devices.</p>
<p>The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM. However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>Retail Pro is the chosen software platform for omni-channel strategy by retailers in 130+ countries. Tailored retail POS system hardware bundles for your iPad and Mac or PC desktop workstations. With Square for Restaurants, for example, you get POS software that's geared specifically for restaurant use.
