<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds. As with all POS systems, owners can track sales, deliveries, inventory, employee schedules, and payroll. Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp. Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis. On the surface, most point of sale systems promise the same basic functionality: The ability to accept payments, track sales, manage inventory, and keep track of customer data. There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Hence it is important to keep a credit card terminal in any retail store or restaurant. Built by an industry expert, Upserve is a POS system with everything needed for restaurant, nightclub, bar, or café management. Smaller retailers are moving away from these traditional POS systems and toward cloud based point of sale solutions.</p>

Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>Some bar POS systems are also known to integrate a time clock module with tip tracking. Either your retail business runs in a single, or multiple store locations, it deserves to run Simply.
