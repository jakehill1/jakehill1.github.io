<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye. Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>

<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception. Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description. POS packages frequently come with integrated accounting modules, including general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and inventory control systems.</p>
