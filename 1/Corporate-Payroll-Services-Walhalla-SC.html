<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Actually, it is one of the best-priced POS systems for small bars. For those new to the world of point of service (POS), it's software that offers retail automation replacing the traditional register. This trend is growing stronger as retailers realize that customers now use stores as real-world catalogs, sizing up goods before looking online for a better deal.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
