Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>

It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market.
