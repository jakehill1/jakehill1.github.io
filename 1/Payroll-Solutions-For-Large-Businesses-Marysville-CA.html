<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. Self-service kiosks - A large self-service kiosk can help customers serve themselves, saving your staff time. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant. On top of payment processing fees, many point of sale systems will charge your business for using their software. The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges.</p>

You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>

Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
