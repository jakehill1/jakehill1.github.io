<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster.

If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>Many times the systems were confusing, and this meant increased hours spent training staff members on the functionality of the systems. Tracking sales by items, department, and hours, plus costs for food, labor, and other expenses are some important KPIs needed. The Zebra Scanner DS2208 is a two-dimensional barcode scanner that is widely used by retail stores for scanning product barcodes, electronic coupons, and even membership cards.</p>
<p>First Data and ICICI Merchant Services combines a payment gateway and point-of-sale software and hardware solutions with features such as card & check acceptance, and merchant mobile commerce solutions, and ecommerce gateway. Another helpful option is setting up a few kiosks in your large retail store for your customers to look up pricing and product availability. POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>
