<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Reporting in Excel or PDF format from replenishment to goods received and sales reports, there is a wealth of reporting at your disposal with the option of re-ordering through purchase order function all controlled within head office. The General Store is a POS and retail management system that you can use to process sales, track inventory, reorder stock, track employee time and commissions, and manage customers.</p>
<p>Infor POS is a stable, secure, and scalable cloud-based POS solution for hotels, restaurants and other hospitality organizations. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver. These registers have been replaced by technology known as point of sale (POS) systems; which nowadays are highly sophisticated and are the backbone of any business where sales are involved.</p>

<p>Some bar POS systems are also known to integrate a time clock module with tip tracking. Either your retail business runs in a single, or multiple store locations, it deserves to run Simply. A great system also allows nightclub owners and managers to see exactly how their business is performing in real-time, from anywhere. Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. You should be able to see updated sales figures in real time, and run reports on your cost of labor, product profitability, individual employee performance, and more.</p>

<p>Identifying your point-of-sale needs can be as easy as finding out what your competitors (or other businesses similar to yours) are using or as difficult as performing an in-depth study of every transaction you process. Its design team, which is made up of former waiters, bartenders and restaurant managers, has tweaked the system based on workers' needs. Research has shown repeatedly that errors are dozens of times more likely with manually calculated balances as opposed to those derived at automatically by software.</p>

Better still, it wraps up all the needed features into an easy-to-understand interface: Sales, billing, inventory, layout management, analytics reports and loyalty programs are included.</p>
<p>However, a POS system like TouchBistro is more ideal for large-scale restaurants who need advanced features like detailed reporting and forecasting. Whether you're a retail shop, grocery store, clothing store, liquor store, or anything in between, ShopKeep's #1-rated POS solution streamlines your day-to-day. This POS leader has some of the premier hardware and software in its industry. Each time an item is ordered through the POS it is removed from the current inventory.</p>
<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
