<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Our restaurant point of sale (POS) systems are also designed to support the highest level of customer service, allowing you to create the dining experiences that will delight customers and earn their loyalty. Their interface allows you to present detailed menu options with photos, descriptions, and prices so new staff can familiarize themselves with the food in a flash. Combined, the tools are particularly handy for streamlining the management of multiple restaurant locations.</p>
<p>Moreover, POS and restaurant management solutions out there are a dime a dozen, and cherry-picking the best isn't that simple. A POS terminal is the device that the mobile POS software runs on. With TallySoft's POS software, TallySales, your pro shop will benefit from a proven solution that provides robust functionalities at an affordability that's right for your business.

Physical stores have traditionally placed their POS at store exits to increase impulse purchases by customers leaving the store. Alternatively, some cloud POS software offers an offline mode that keeps the POS functioning during no connectivity, then syncs all the new data with the backend when the local system is back online.</p>
<p>A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal. Multichannel Customer Experience — retailers who manage online stores along with physical stores should have the option in their POS system to provide the same consistent product and pricing information to their customers, whether online or onsite.</p>
