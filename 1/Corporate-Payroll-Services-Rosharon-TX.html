<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management. Not all POS software has this option and Managers will thank you for this. IoT-enabled POS systems will eliminate the need for retailers to manually keep track of inventory, reducing the losses arising from storing excess or inadequate inventory.</p>
<p>Pet stores benefit from the ability to track individual pets in inventory as well as make customer notes pertaining to pets in the system. Reports provide customer counts, sales information, and cost and historical data, on-site and remotely. Create a POS to suit your business - build your setup with sleek, cutting-edge hardware and accessories. Mink Foodiee Master control helps you keep a track of all your restaurants and manage them from one Central POS.</p>

The system connects with your credit card processor so transactions can be processed in real time. Those in need of a full-service POS system that handles reservations nimbly should consider Cake, particularly if they want to avoid the hefty up-front investment required when buying their own hardware instead of leasing it through Cake.</p>

<p>As much as possible, go for a POS that can boost profits by providing a fast and efficient check-out process, manage inventory and sales reports, and provide income generating programs like loyalty rewards and discount promos. Customers can even tip, sign, and request digital, text, or email receipts right on the handheld POS interface. The hardware and software that's best depend on your business needs. The best bar POS system must have easy-to-use software and compatible hardware to process and record sales.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>In its favour for UK customers, it is the only UK based hospitality POS software that provides online and phone support specifically in the UK. Our unique software captures drink movement across the bar counters through video cameras and matches all sales to the POS data.

<p>Other functions of a POS system are to maintain sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to.</p>

<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database.
