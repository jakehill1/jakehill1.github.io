<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. Receive and adjust your inventory items each time you get more items in stock to keep your retail store's inventory levels, and your costs, accurate. They've found this provides an opportunity to focus on customers looking for specific product types and to influence their purchasing decisions earlier on in the sales process.

We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers.

<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.

Mobile ordering and handheld processing devices are the latest trend, giving you the flexibility to move around the store, offering customers a more personal experience, and freeing up congestion at the checkout counter.
