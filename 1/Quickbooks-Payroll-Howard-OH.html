The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. If the quality of the software, support, and services will prove itself as an investment — not just an extra business expense — it'll be worth it.</p>

You don't have to take our word for it though; here are some examples of happy Vend customers and what they have to say about our POS system.
