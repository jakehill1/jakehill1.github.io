<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Actually, it is one of the best-priced POS systems for small bars. For those new to the world of point of service (POS), it's software that offers retail automation replacing the traditional register. This trend is growing stronger as retailers realize that customers now use stores as real-world catalogs, sizing up goods before looking online for a better deal. In today's market, investing in an mPOS is much cheaper than investing in a POS software Thus instead of spending an extra amount of money over a regular POS software, you could actually invest in our contemporary mPOS software system that will not only help you to save an extra penny but will also provide you with added features.</p>
<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types. A mobile POS system means better, faster customer management processes. Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.</p>
<p>Perhaps utilizing a particular system can enable you to come up with sales geared towards specific groups of customers whom you wish to attract to your store. Further software that may be suitable for your bar EPOS are offered as add-ons which include accounting, time clock, online store management and more. Offering EMV payment will provide your customers with peace of mind. Lightspeed POS is a good all-round Retail POS System, but a great one for businesses with complex inventories.</p>

<p>If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. This is especially true when the rush in the retail stores is more. Reporting and Back Office - The users can review the sales reports and can manage inventory, employees along with the customers. If you choose a cloud-based restaurant POS system, you'll be able to make changes to your menu or pricing on the fly.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>PayPal lets businesses of all sizes, including startups and microbusinesses, accept credit cards with minimal application requirements.

On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
