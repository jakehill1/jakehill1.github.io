<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>
<p>Organize menu items, categories, choice sets and modifiers to customize your restaurant POS to meet the needs and offerings of your restaurant. If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space. Union, a POS system designed for bars and restaurants, prides itself on being a fast system for busy businesses.</p>
<p>But if you're specifically opening a pizza shop, for example, there are POS systems built just for that with integrations that allow online ordering and delivery tracking. Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table.</p>

Shopify POS and Intuit QuickBooks Point of Sale charge monthly subscription fees for the use of their software along with an additional fee for payment processing.</p>
<p>All modern POS systems have a frontend interface for the point of sale and a backend (sometimes called ‘backoffice' or ‘dashboard') side for behind-the-scenes analytics and management functions. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this.

Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>

<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food.

Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction.</p>
