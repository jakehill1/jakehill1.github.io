<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check. Then when it comes to payment processing, Square for restaurants proves to be quite a flexible solution. This is a suitable point-of-sale option if you do not manage a lot of inventory and you need to be mobile. Besides, nowadays, most of the barcode scanner may also integrate with Inventory Management system to change stock levels automatically and efficiently.</p>

Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>
