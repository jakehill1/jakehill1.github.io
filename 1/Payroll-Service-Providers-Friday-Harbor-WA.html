<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>
<p>Some POS systems focus on quick service, while others on full service.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
