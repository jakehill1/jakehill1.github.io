<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments.
