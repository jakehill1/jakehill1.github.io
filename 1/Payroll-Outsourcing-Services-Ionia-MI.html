<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>And that's precisely where a POS system for restaurants comes in. It's the one application you need in your food truck, coffee shop, fast food service outlet, or bar to streamline the entire business. In store and eCommerce packages for Cumulus Retail are available in scalable versions so as you grow, your Point Of Sale software and eCommerce system growth with you.

Point of sale systems used to be stand-alone and front-end systems running on independent databases.</p>
<p>A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. The right POS system can streamline every operation of your restaurant, bar, or cafe, from orders and payments to your entire ingredient inventory. Depending on the needs of your business after you have achieved the minimum functionality, there are some other features you might want to look for such as the ability for customers to use two forms of payment for surge pricing, gift cards, or special pricing (for special customers or sales) to allow for returns.</p>
