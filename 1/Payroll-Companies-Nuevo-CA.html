<p>The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. The software window has several columns such as items bought, quantity of each item, sales taxes, total payable amount, amount tendered and balance for the customer. Square POS has become one of the most widely used point of sale systems out there—and for good reason.</p>
<p>Its retail offerings include pcAmerica and LiquorPOS, and its restaurant options include Dinerware, Digital Dining and Xpient.
