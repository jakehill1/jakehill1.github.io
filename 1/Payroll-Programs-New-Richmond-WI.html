<p>The point-of-sale is where it all happens. Technology is now a necessary part of providing the experience guests expect at bars and restaurants. You may also want to check out our guide to restaurant management system to find out more about its features and benefits. Franpos cloud-based point-of-sale and multi-unit management solution is designed for Quick Service Restaurants.

<p>IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors. Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
<p>And that's precisely where a POS system for restaurants comes in. It's the one application you need in your food truck, coffee shop, fast food service outlet, or bar to streamline the entire business. In store and eCommerce packages for Cumulus Retail are available in scalable versions so as you grow, your Point Of Sale software and eCommerce system growth with you.

Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
