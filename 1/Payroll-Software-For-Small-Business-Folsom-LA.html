The FoodEngine POS which has promised results for many restaurants comes in two licenses — Perpetual (both Annual and Monthly premiums) and SaaS (only Monthly Premium). You can process payments on your store's floor (especially useful for cutting down lines at the register during busy seasons), at an expo, or at an outdoor pop-up shop.</p>
<p>Make sure to see how the management and reporting features actually work before you pay any money. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>
<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking. Imagine restaurant POS systems that can tell which customers are in which seat at which table, and charge them for their food individually and automatically without a single credit card passing hands.</p>

<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software). Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs. Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>Because of this, retailers and POS vendors worked to standardise the development of computerised Point of Sale systems and to simplify the interconnectivity of Point of Sale devices.
