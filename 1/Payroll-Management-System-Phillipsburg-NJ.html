<p>Choosing your point of sale, or POS, systems could be a disaster if you approach the wrong dealer and go for the wrong equipment. A member database that supports targeted marketing such as coupons and points schemes has high value in increasing sales and keeping customers. Toast is an all-in-one management solution for restauranteurs. Getting holistic, real-time data in the hands of key decision makers allows them to take immediate action and improve performance in your stores. Any store that has a point of sale and point of purchase can use POS software.</p>
<p>The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Rezku was founded in 2012 by veteran restaurant owner Paul Katsch to bring the best technology to the food and beverage service industry. Alongside menu management are the inventory tracking functions. Easily manage and help grow your business when you use a PayPal card reader with one of our POS partners. Toast's integrated CRM software can help you build an inventory of loyal customers and craft messages and promotions to keep your guests happy and your business profitable.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
