<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.

It's easy to use features and customer friendly user interface help in a number of advantages that not only give your restaurant business a sophisticated feel but also helps in drawing quick sales through speedy orders and effective management.</p>
