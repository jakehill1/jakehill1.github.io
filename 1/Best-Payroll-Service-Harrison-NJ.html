Actually, it is one of the best-priced POS systems for small bars. For those new to the world of point of service (POS), it's software that offers retail automation replacing the traditional register. This trend is growing stronger as retailers realize that customers now use stores as real-world catalogs, sizing up goods before looking online for a better deal.
