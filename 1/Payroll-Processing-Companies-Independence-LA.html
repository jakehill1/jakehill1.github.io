For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>
<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments.
