<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Continue selling even when the internet goes down, Your Restaurant Software will automatically re-sync sales when online. This tool enables the app to receive and handle payments using credit or debit cards, straight from your mobile gadget. Special reports can include sales for each hour of the day for any time period. Manage multi-location operations in one account or use our bar POS system for franchises. Our restaurant management systems have the same functionality and features, for a fraction of the price.</p>

We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers. Lessen the rush at bar by letting customers order drinks directly from the app. For instance, if you own a retail store, you need a retail POS system.</p>
