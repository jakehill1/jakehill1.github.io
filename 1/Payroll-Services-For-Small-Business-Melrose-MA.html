POSsible POS Frozen Yogurt POS software integrates directly with a food-safe scale, making it easier to communicate. Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need.</p>
<p>Many times the systems were confusing, and this meant increased hours spent training staff members on the functionality of the systems. Tracking sales by items, department, and hours, plus costs for food, labor, and other expenses are some important KPIs needed. The Zebra Scanner DS2208 is a two-dimensional barcode scanner that is widely used by retail stores for scanning product barcodes, electronic coupons, and even membership cards.</p>
<p>Customers can pay by chip, swipe and tap like Apple Pay® and Google Pay, at the point of sale or on the go. Both the retail and restaurant versions of its POS software have a rich assortment of back-office tools to help you manage your business, with inventory, purchase ordering, reporting and CRM features.

<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere.
