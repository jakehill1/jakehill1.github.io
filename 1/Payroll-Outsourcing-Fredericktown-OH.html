Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.

<p>If the sound POS system is connected to the computerized accounting system, then the user can clear credit cards, record transactions manage sales, and collect taxes quickly. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
<p>With it you can manage multiple store locations, send digital receipts, issue discounts, work offline, and accept credit card payments through an integration with credit card processor Vantiv (processing rates vary depending on your business). Besides quicker service, tableside makes settling bills easier for your customers. It's not all third-party integrations, of course: Within the software interface itself, ingredients can be tracked individually through the inventory management features, a floor plan display helps guide servers to the table they need when they need it, and a menu that supports photos of each meal to be included with each description.</p>
<p>In-person customers will be well-served through the service, which includes contactless payment in its hardware options. The solution helps you free up staff so they can focus on providing quality service to your customers. Ultimately, restaurant software can be useful in tracking guest behavior, giving you the ability to track top-selling menu items. Opt for a POS provider that gives you the ability to choose your credit card processor Otherwise, you could be stuck paying higher fees to whomever it chooses.</p>
