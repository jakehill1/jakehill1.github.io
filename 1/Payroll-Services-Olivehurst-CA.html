This is usually available via integration with a restaurant management system.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic).

Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

WillPower Pos systems were developed to suit a wide variety of businesses from Retail to Hospitality and specialized shops. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>
