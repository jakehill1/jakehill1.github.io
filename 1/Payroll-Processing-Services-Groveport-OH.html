<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>However, customers tend to abandon their cards if the balances get below a certain amount. Built with advanced inventory features, in-house marketing capabilities, and the ability to integrate with virtually any payment processor, talech takes your standard POS to the next level. Some point of sale systems only accept online payments. By using an API-led approach to connectivity, Buffalo Wild Wings was able to integrate their POS system to not one, but three systems--creating a unique solution that provides their restaurant chains with unprecedented visibility into their beer inventory.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload. Much like online ordering, customers are interested in on-demand services that reduce wait times. Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>
