<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of POS companies available online, and the cost and prices will vary depending on the type of business environment you have and how many terminals you will need. Most POS systems have integrations with other technologies, like accounting, inventory management, your website CMS, staff management, and marketing. Smartphone POS services can process payments and manage some inventory and customer information.</p>

<p>With each of these systems comes different hardware and capabilities from different brands, including hardware, software, and additional features. Future growth — As your total orders, order stations, or restaurant locations grow, the cost for your POS system will grow, even though the features it offers likely won't. POS is the setup you have in place for processing face-to-face payments from customers. If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders.</p>
