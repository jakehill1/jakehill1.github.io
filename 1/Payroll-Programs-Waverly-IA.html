<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. Retail and gaming POS solution that offers employee access controls, inventory tracking, check splitting, and loyalty cards. Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers. TouchSystems understands that reality and helps people to discover those tools, whether they be self-service kiosks, digital signage or point of sale (POS) terminals.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>

Epos Now is the best all-in-one POS system for businesses because it is affordable, versatile and easily adaptable to your business. The great thing about choosing a POS company that provides both types of hardware is that you always have multiple options to find the right hardware to match your unique business setup.</p>
<p>Seating plans — The advantage of a POS system is that you can dynamically seat customers as tables become available.

The systems even allow retailers to create self-service kiosks for their customers, so they can search for items they want themselves.</p>

<p>Increased Employee Customer Interaction: Because POS systems are efficient at reducing the amount of time employees have to spend doing business operation tasks, they will have more time to spend with the customer. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>Aside from the POS system, it features customizable menu management. POS systems have given a huge boost to many of the retail business owners, because they not only speed up payment services, but also give real-time information about inventory and customers. Better still, it wraps up all the needed features into an easy-to-understand interface: Sales, billing, inventory, layout management, analytics reports and loyalty programs are included.</p>
