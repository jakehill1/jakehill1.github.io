Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
<p>Interested businesses can give Quickbooks' POS a free trial and pricing is dependent on the hardware and software bundle a business opts for. Many systems let you individually track employee details, shifts, payroll, and more and then send that data to accounting software.

Food service establishments can be broken down into two basic categories, the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) and the Full Service Restaurant (FSR). You can train your sales staff to keep an eye on queue length and whip out Retail Pro POS on a tablet to open up additional check stands so you make sure your customers get a good last impression.</p>
