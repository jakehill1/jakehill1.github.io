<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>The accurate records of sales and inventory will help you determine which products are selling and which are not. POS systems have three parts: software, hardware and a credit card processor. A basic ‘starter' bundle will cost around £1,795 and includes the bar POS software along with a touchscreen PC, cash drawer, receipt printer, and card reader. Besides the great point of sale features, TouchBistro offers superb remote management and a strong reporting system.</p>
<p>Cash Drawers - As long as a cash drawer is a printer-model with an RJ12 connection, you should be able to use it with TouchBistro Restaurant POS. There will be less sale entry mistakes so customer wait time will be drastically reduced allowing more time to serve more customers.
