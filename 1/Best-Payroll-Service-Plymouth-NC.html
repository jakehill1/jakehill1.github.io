Ability to manage accounts payable, including support for both balance forward (for example, credit cards) and open item accounts, and the ability to reconcile accounts with monthly statements. Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry." Indeed, scanning became a ubiquitous feature in many of the nation's most modestly-sized retail outlets during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction.</p>
<p>The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. The software window has several columns such as items bought, quantity of each item, sales taxes, total payable amount, amount tendered and balance for the customer.

<p>If the sound POS system is connected to the computerized accounting system, then the user can clear credit cards, record transactions manage sales, and collect taxes quickly. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
