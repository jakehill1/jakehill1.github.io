<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.</p>
