<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from. In its most basic definition, a POS system is a combination of POS hardware and POS software to create a POS machine for processing a transaction and payment. Catering: Using this restaurant management system, you can manage catering orders for wedding, office parties and other social gatherings.</p>
<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business.

With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>
<p>FusionRestro includes accounting, billing, staff and payroll functions, inventory management, and customer information management. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem. As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>
