<p>Technology has been moving at an amazing avalanche pace. With a POS system, your employees will be able to efficiently manage bar tabs with software that's connected between servers and bar staff, reducing confusion and miscommunication between servers, the bar, and kitchen. A large library of integrations helps this iPad POS stand out as one of the more flexible restaurant services. Our restaurant POS software is trusted by over 20,000 restaurants and has the features and flexibility to meet a variety of needs.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Brigade POS was developed by a team of experienced restauranteurs and software innovators who wanted to address the 3 core problems inherent with almost every POS system: 1. Reliability. Every business is unique, and TallySales Retail Management Systems allows you to run your business your way.</p>

<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it.

The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>
