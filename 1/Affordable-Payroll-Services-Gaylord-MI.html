<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. You'll probably want a traditional set-up with a full-service POS if you have a retail store , salon, dry cleaner, or quick-serve restaurant Consider countertop POS systems, which are available in various sizes and take less space than traditional cash registers. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With older POS systems, managers had a lot more workload. Much like online ordering, customers are interested in on-demand services that reduce wait times.
