<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. To keep the service and guest experience seamless, you need a nightclub or bar POS system that can keep up with the rush. The POS hardware you need for your bar will typically include a tablet, tablet stand, receipt printer, cash drawer, and credit card terminal or card reader.</p>
<p>Entered items are displayed in the receipt window and are ready for payment by either taking cash or swiping a credit card at any time.

By having a POS system in place, you can understand your customers better and boost your sales significantly. Take a variety of payments with the Square magstripe reader, offer customers digital receipts and track sales in real-time.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard restaurant-centric features, it offers many useful features specific to bars.
