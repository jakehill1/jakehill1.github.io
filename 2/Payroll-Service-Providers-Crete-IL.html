<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Organize menu items, categories, choice sets and modifiers to customize your restaurant POS to meet the needs and offerings of your restaurant. If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space. Union, a POS system designed for bars and restaurants, prides itself on being a fast system for busy businesses.</p>
<p>Substitutions, drink recipe lists, price scheduling, tab management, and split inventory for liquor pours are just a few features to look for in bar POS software. Another important aspect of POS software is broad support for new payment systems. Lightspeed register terminals are iPad-based and provide access to the backend business management system. However, it is advisable to opt for the software that best suits your business requirements and smoothens your business operations to provide top-notch customer service.</p>

<p>Not only does this give your sales associates tools to better serve your customers - because they'll have access to shoppers' purchasing history and preferences for clienteling and they'll be able to get them what they want every time - but it will also give you the meticulous visibility you need to really see what's happening in your business. Depending on the needs of your restaurant, you can find an efficient restaurant management software starting from anywhere around ₹43, 000 for the software, per user.</p>
<p>A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service.

Retailers have the ability to implement special promotions or establish customer loyalty programs to encourage customers to purchase popular items. A restaurant management system helps a restaurant manage all the different types of orders, menus, shifts, tables, billings, payments and everything on all counts.</p>
<p>Ideal for retail and restaurants to speed up operations and grow sales. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. And this is what point-of-sale (POS) software is all about. Most of our customers have increased their profits and maximized control over their business in just few weeks. It can be used by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, cafes, bars, food retailers and hotels.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>All you really need is a system that has online capabilities, which makes them perfect for businesses that can't afford (or simply don't want to) replace their existing hardware. Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Having a POS system that can automatically track and control the inventory is a great benefit to business owners, as they can hire less stock personnel and reduce time in monitoring stock.</p>

Inventory Management : Restaurant POS software makes inventory management easier and more accurate. A multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets.</p>
