<p>Among the most common inventory management features available in POS software are reminders to inform you when stock of a certain product is running low. Vend is mobile, so you can take your point of sale system onto the shop floor, beat the queues and build personal engagement with your customers. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services.</p>

Square POS also sells Square Stand, an iPad contactless and chip stand that allows contactless payments as well as chip cards, NFC and magstripe.

Offline Functionalities - Although your internet service provider probably guarantees an uninterrupted internet connection, you cannot afford to risk your restaurant business by taking their word for it. Instead, you should be prepared for possible downtimes by leveraging a restaurant POS system that maintains normal business operations even after going offline.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
