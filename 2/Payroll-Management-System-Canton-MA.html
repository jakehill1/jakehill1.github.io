<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>From inventory management, custom barcode printing, and purchase order creation, the platform has all the features you need to handle the sales process and implement fast checkouts. The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals.
