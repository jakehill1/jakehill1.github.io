<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Grow your retail business, your repeat customers, and your profits, with our top-rated point of sale system.Experience fast and seamless transactions with simpler interface and hot keys. This enables your customers to shop virtually anywhere as the software integrates processes and channels to deliver dependable shopping experience across all your channels, letting customers select store to home or store to store delivery.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals.

<p>At the till, on the shop floor, at a special event or in the field - Infinity POS software works at any fixed or mobile location, bringing salespeople to customers anywhere. The restaurant POS software does not work well with the retailer's needs. Customers have special requests all the time. DW systems get updated from the data that comes from the POS systems. Shopify POS and Intuit QuickBooks Point of Sale charge monthly subscription fees for the use of their software along with an additional fee for payment processing.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
