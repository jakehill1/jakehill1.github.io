Its POS system is built primarily for restaurants and other food-based businesses, though retail stores can also use it. It is affordable, has no lengthy contract requirement, is compatible with third-party POS hardware and has a good selection of features.

<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
