For retailers, only Cumulus Retail offers a simple solution with the power to scale to a national enterprise network of stores over time. And while the software half of the POS system equation is probably most important, especially in a cloud-based solution, many retail businesses will still require a hardware half.</p>
<p>Our typical retail POS system includes a touchscreen computer, cash drawer, barcode scanner, MSR (credit card swipe), and receipt printer. This software supports Offline modes as well as Online modes and it gives immense security to your data in both the modes. Customers can also interact directly with POS systems, particularly in the hospitality industry.

Customers can pay with multiple tender types and can accept two or more payment types in a single transaction.</p>
<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>

With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so.
