<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. Rather than paying a hefty monthly fee for bar POS software, this POS has streamlined base pricing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>If your vision calls for an integrated retail management solution that delivers an exceptional user and customer experience, you've come to the right place. It helps you manage database easily and save time to enter again the number of products being purchased in a day. For example, Square offers a customer loyalty program where customers earn redeemable points on sales.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
