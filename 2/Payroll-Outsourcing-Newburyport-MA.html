<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

Understanding what a POS system is—its software and hardware components, as well as capabilities—will enable you to make an educated buying decision.</p>
<p>A point of sale system allows you as a business owner to control your inventory levels in real time. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS.</p>

Although cloud-based software is easy to deploy and maintain for most bars, Ligan said it can be slow and prone to crash if you have an unstable internet connection.</p>
<p>From the fast interface to quick checkouts, quality report, easy menu configuration setup, table management and a lot more, it takes care of everything depending on your restaurant business requirements. POS systems are computerized networks that consist of the main station that syncs with other terminals in the restaurant.

<p>Retailers need to consider the negative consequences of failing to have a POS in place. According to the State of Small Business report, an incredible 46% of small businesses don't track their inventory or use a manual process to do so. A Point Of Sale (POS) System is the combination of hardware and software that is used to sell stuff to customers, and organise the processes related to sales. The point of sale system is designed for delivery, carry-out or dine-in type restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>To support the customers that still want to pay cash, most businesses need a cash drawer. Restaurant point of sale systems can make your restaurant run much more efficiently. It's the tool you use to analyze and order your inventory, employees, customers, and sales. Nearly all retail operations in stores to day would be more time consuming and expensive to perform if it weren't for the power of a point of sale system.</p>
<p>Small businesses should expect to pay somewhere between $40 and $100 per month for a POS system with a single cash register. The software includes register features, vendor and inventory management, reports, and a loyalty program. This allows the owner to keep a close tab on his staff as well as customers. Our POS software for bars can help you run your business more efficiently and handle all your daily tasks free of stress.</p>
