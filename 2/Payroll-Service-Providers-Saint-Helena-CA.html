<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations. This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>
<p>Customers can pay by chip, swipe and tap like Apple Pay® and Google Pay, at the point of sale or on the go. Both the retail and restaurant versions of its POS software have a rich assortment of back-office tools to help you manage your business, with inventory, purchase ordering, reporting and CRM features. One such function includes the synergies, which are created by assimilating them with different kinds of back-end applications like inventory management and customer relationship management ( CRM ).</p>

<p>Apt for - ticket sales, large retail stores, parking, human resources. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. More established businesses can take advantage of advanced features such as kitchen display systems, digital menu boards, online ordering and self-ordering kiosks.

Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough. You should be able to see updated sales figures in real time, and run reports on your cost of labor, product profitability, individual employee performance, and more.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
