<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>Restaurant Point of Sale Systems do much more than the typical Restaurant POS Cash Register. With a handheld mPOS your customers do not need to line up and wait at the counter when they have to place an order. The customers were required to go to the cash register where their credit cards could be processed. A typical EPoS system in not capable of being all things to all men, so it's essential that it has the capacity to be integrated into other systems within the business.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>
