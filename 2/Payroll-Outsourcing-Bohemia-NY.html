<p>Restaurant POS systems should also protect against any possible inside, employee theft. Modern POS systems for bars remedy this problem for bar owners by leveraging cloud technology to create always-accessible reports. The point of sale offers a tremendous opportunity to get to know your customers and to appeal to their consumer needs. You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>
