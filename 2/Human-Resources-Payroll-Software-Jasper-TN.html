Restaurant point of sale systems, or restaurant POS, allow restaurants to deliver great customer service by managing orders, payment, and promotions.

<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard.
