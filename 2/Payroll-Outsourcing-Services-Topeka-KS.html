<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>

<h3>What Makes Good Payment Processing Software Topeka Kansas</h3>
<p>Whether you're planning to get into this exciting industry or are already in it, understand that competition is stiff and almost always, between two restaurants with an equally successful menu, how efficient you provide customer service is the deal-breaker. Bindo is another iPad POS system that boasts sophisticated—yet user-friendly—inventory management features. A slow and clunky bar POS system doesn't slow down your ability to hand customers their check; it also disenchants your staff and employee turnover rates are a significant problem for bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Make sure to see how the management and reporting features actually work before you pay any money. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>
<p>As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>

To be completely accurate, we can say that POS refers to the hardware and software which cashiers use for checkouts.</p>
<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
