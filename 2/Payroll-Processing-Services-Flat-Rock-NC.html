Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so.

Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
