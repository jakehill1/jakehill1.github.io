<p>For restaurants, POS software is seen to continue to harness the power of the cloud as doing so makes them accessible anytime, anywhere. So these POS systems have powerful tools for quickly taking orders in the front of the house and keeping up with the hectic operations and inventory needs in the back. Point of sale equipment allows for effective management of these programs.

<p>It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. The only major complaint with QuickBooks is that it isn't recommended for many basic types of businesses, including full-service restaurants and retail stores with brick-and-mortar locations. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Its mobile implementation is equally capable with a one-touch payment feature to support a responsive build and superior micro-moments technology to drive your brand and actual growth of sales.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
