Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems. Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The software features advanced caller ID integration to easily manage incoming calls.</p>
