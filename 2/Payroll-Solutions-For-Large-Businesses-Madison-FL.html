<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types. A mobile POS system means better, faster customer management processes. Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.</p>
<p>But if you're specifically opening a pizza shop, for example, there are POS systems built just for that with integrations that allow online ordering and delivery tracking. Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table.</p>

<p>With each of these systems comes different hardware and capabilities from different brands, including hardware, software, and additional features. Future growth — As your total orders, order stations, or restaurant locations grow, the cost for your POS system will grow, even though the features it offers likely won't. POS is the setup you have in place for processing face-to-face payments from customers. If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders.</p>
<p>A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. The right POS system can streamline every operation of your restaurant, bar, or cafe, from orders and payments to your entire ingredient inventory. Depending on the needs of your business after you have achieved the minimum functionality, there are some other features you might want to look for such as the ability for customers to use two forms of payment for surge pricing, gift cards, or special pricing (for special customers or sales) to allow for returns.</p>

In business, the customer data is helpful for advertising as it offers insights regarding which customer would be paying attention in the sale.</p>
<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction.</p>
