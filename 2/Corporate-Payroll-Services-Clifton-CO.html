<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind. If you are a retail business that needs more than just a light-weight cloud POS system, POSIM is right for you. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>

However, with hundreds of POS systems on the market, sifting through them to find the best solution for your business is overwhelming.</p>
<p>The Revel POS is designed to be a full restaurant POS system, managing finance and accounting in addition to sales, inventory, and staff.

<p>Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions. A point of sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well.</p>
