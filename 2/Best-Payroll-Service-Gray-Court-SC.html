<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers. Recently purchased by Upserve, the low-cost, user-friendly Upserve caters to bars, clubs, and restaurants. The POS hardware includes an internet-enabled device that can run the POS software, plus transaction tools like a receipt printer and a cash drawer.

<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers.
