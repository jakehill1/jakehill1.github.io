<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. In addition to POS services, Habortouch also offers access to online reservations, employee management systems, and a customer database. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.

<p>Cash registers are often slower, and more limited in their options and methods of payment then a POS. In this way, retailers will lose fewer sales. If we revisit IBISWorld's three factors of success for bar owners (loyal customers, latest technology, proper inventory management), it's clear to see how a mobile POS system for bars can help a bar business achieve each of those objectives. The POS built to simplify restaurant operations and delight your customers.</p>
<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases.

With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>
<p>Though they are essential to handle day to day operation in a retail store or a restaurant, they do not help generating revenue directly. Point of sales software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that allow them to track the most popular products. The intuitive nature of LAVU's system makes it easy to learn and easy to train on, and the feature-rich iPad platform makes it easy to provide five-star customer service.</p>
