<p>A point of sale system is a type of computer or specialized terminal that is used to instantly record a transaction. Loyverse is suited for retail stores, salons, restaurants and cafes. Inventory management is a key omnichannel challenge and accurate allocation and replenishment are critical to customer satisfaction. Some POS software providers have proprietary POS hardware that you're required to use, while some providers let you use third-party hardware components. POSitouch offers a premium software suite with the features and functionality to support restaurants of all sizes, from independent locations to the biggest national chains.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>
