<p>Any retail store that wants to stay in business for a long time will appreciate every customer that walks through the front door; the question is whether or not they will choose to display that appreciation. At the same time updating between multiple stations and the back end administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the back end administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.</p>

And comprehensive inventory, analytic reports, and QuickBooks integration can help you understand your business and customers better.

For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?"

<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers.
