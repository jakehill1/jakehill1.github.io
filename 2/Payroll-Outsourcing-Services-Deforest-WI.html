<p>Reward vouchers printed at point of sale can help keep diners and drinkers loyal. The right POS software can speed up your in-store sales process, eliminate manual tasks, and improve the accuracy of your reporting. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. The Full Service program is designed for restaurants, bars, breweries, and nightclubs while their Quick Service option is ideal for cafés, food trucks, bakeries, and fast-food service.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

You can enjoy an increase in profits in no time whether it's adding new staff, installing a cash register, experimenting with different sales channels, or opening a new physical store. Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality.</p>
<p>A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal. Multichannel Customer Experience — retailers who manage online stores along with physical stores should have the option in their POS system to provide the same consistent product and pricing information to their customers, whether online or onsite.</p>

The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>All POS transaction data entered into the application is automatically synchronized in real-time with your Erply account, leaving all of your books and reports completely accurate all the time.
