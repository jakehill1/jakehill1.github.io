<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.</p>
<p>More than simply a way to take orders and ring up sales, a POS system gives you total control over every important operational aspect of your restaurant. This POS system gives the owner features like inventory and sales tracking, monitoring products, and menu items, and generating reports. Today we're using Retail Pro in 350 stores worldwide. They can handle numerous kinds of payments and communicate well with back-end accounting software.</p>
<p>Manage your retail business from the front of the store to the back with a robust, extended lifecycle retail platform that's equally at home at the point of sale (POS), within a kiosk enclosure or behind the scenes. Not only do you want your point of sale system to make it easy for you to take payments, you also want to be able to manage your orders, inventory, and employees. No matter whether you choose to use other Point of Success products and services or stay with just our free restaurant software, Point of Success Special Edition will cost nothing to use.</p>

Point of sale systems used to be stand-alone and front-end systems running on independent databases.</p>
<p>A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. The right POS system can streamline every operation of your restaurant, bar, or cafe, from orders and payments to your entire ingredient inventory. Depending on the needs of your business after you have achieved the minimum functionality, there are some other features you might want to look for such as the ability for customers to use two forms of payment for surge pricing, gift cards, or special pricing (for special customers or sales) to allow for returns.</p>

Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>
<p>Some POS systems cater to retailers , whereas others cater to restaurants, so be sure to look for one that fits your specific needs. Accounting and payroll: Your POS system may include accounting services or integrate with third-party software like QuickBooks. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.</p>
<p>It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon.

There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically.</p>

<p>The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. As retailers adopt new POS strategies, they will generate a wealth of data that will yield new insights into customer behaviour, inventory, pricing, sales trends and more. Top-rated restaurant POS systems also offer preset tipping options, built-in distribution, and server payout calculators.</p>
