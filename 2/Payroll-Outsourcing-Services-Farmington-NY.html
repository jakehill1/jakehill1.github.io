Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés.</p>
<p>A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal.
