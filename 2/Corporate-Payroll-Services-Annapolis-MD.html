<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
