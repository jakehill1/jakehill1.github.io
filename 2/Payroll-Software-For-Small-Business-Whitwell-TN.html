<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow. Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>Pet stores benefit from the ability to track individual pets in inventory as well as make customer notes pertaining to pets in the system. Reports provide customer counts, sales information, and cost and historical data, on-site and remotely. Create a POS to suit your business - build your setup with sleek, cutting-edge hardware and accessories. Mink Foodiee Master control helps you keep a track of all your restaurants and manage them from one Central POS.</p>
