Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>
<p>However, several affordable, cloud-based till systems for small retailers are available today, whether it's for an off-licence, gift shop, florist, bike shop or other independent store. The primary operational use of the Point Of Sale system is to speed up the billing process for the customers at the store.
