<p>Retail point of sale (POS) applications constantly battle adult age verification. Table management view makes it easy to track each table's orders, as well as reservations. ShopKeep's simple, powerful retail POS solution has allowed thousands of business owners to thrive while doing what they adore. Not one interface for all : A custom-made POS system interface calls for the incorporation of the unique in-house features that has taken the bar to its present height. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes.</p>
<p>Key features include table management, coursing, menu management and sales reporting. The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need. Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way.

<p>There are hundreds of companies that exist only to provide their bar and restaurant software to you. TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. This simplifies the payment process for both customers and establishments. Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet ( at Google Pay) Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.</p>

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. POS systems can suffer from internet connectivity problems and software issues. Modern POS speeds transaction times, and mobile POS adds a powerful line-busting tool to your arsenal. The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
