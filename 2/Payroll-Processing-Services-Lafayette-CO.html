Square POS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as accept credit cards with your iPhone, Android, and iPad along with the flexibility to accept credit card payments anywhere, from Square headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter. It is a good idea to talk to your employees and your customers to get feedback on what kinds of features would help. Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.</p>
