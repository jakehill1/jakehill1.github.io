<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling.

Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>

A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The Restaurant Point of Sale software has come a long way from only billing to complete restaurant management. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>

The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well.
