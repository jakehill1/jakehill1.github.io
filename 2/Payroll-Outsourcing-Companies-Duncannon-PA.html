<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>From inventory management, custom barcode printing, and purchase order creation, the platform has all the features you need to handle the sales process and implement fast checkouts. The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Focus POS enables your business to operate without interruption as you manage tables, communicate orders to the kitchen, process payments—and maximize table turnover.</p>
<p>Infor POS is a stable, secure, and scalable cloud-based POS solution for hotels, restaurants and other hospitality organizations. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver.
