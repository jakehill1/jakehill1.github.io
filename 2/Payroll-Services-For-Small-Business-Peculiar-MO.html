<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers.

<p>While Rezku may not have as many robust features as other POS software, it still gives an impressive showing.

This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender. Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>
<p>For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. IPad devices provide a solution that helps eliminate order confusion, lagging service, and incomplete sales data.
