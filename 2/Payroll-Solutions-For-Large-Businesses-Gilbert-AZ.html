<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. By empowering servers with software that can provide myriad services, they can be more efficient and accommodating for customers. W& Retail POS - Point of Sale is perfect for stores offering electronics, clothing, toys, books, baby items, etc. With support for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS, Square POS handles and manages payments, issues digital receipts, provides inventory status updates reports—all essential and outstanding POS capabilities in an easy-to-use interface accessible through multiple devices.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard restaurant-centric features, it offers many useful features specific to bars. Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of.
