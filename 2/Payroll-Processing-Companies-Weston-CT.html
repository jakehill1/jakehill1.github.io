<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>If your bar has a kitchen and serves food, easily send orders from front of the house to kitchen display systems in the back. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. Lavu POS systems centralize your data storage in a cloud-based system to give management complete control over the program. Using the right POS solution for your restaurant can expedite more than just food orders.</p>

This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Meanwhile, the Smart Table Management gives you the real-time status of your tables so that you can keep a close tab on orders and payments.</p>

This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>

<p>You should choose cloud-based bar POS software that enables order taking, payment processing, employee management, inventory tracking, data recording and real-time reporting.
