<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. You'll probably want a traditional set-up with a full-service POS if you have a retail store , salon, dry cleaner, or quick-serve restaurant Consider countertop POS systems, which are available in various sizes and take less space than traditional cash registers. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

One capability they'll look for is a unified commerce platform that allows them to offer customers a seamless shopping experience that spans in-person, online and mobile channels.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
