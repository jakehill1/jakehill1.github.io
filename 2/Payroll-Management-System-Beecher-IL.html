<p>The point-of-sale is where it all happens. Technology is now a necessary part of providing the experience guests expect at bars and restaurants. You may also want to check out our guide to restaurant management system to find out more about its features and benefits. Franpos cloud-based point-of-sale and multi-unit management solution is designed for Quick Service Restaurants. It's our fastest reader ever - processing payments in seconds - and it's easy to integrate with our POS software.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the name Square for Restaurants ” should tell you three things about this POS solution. IVend POS helps retailers reward customer value across all channels with integrated store and online loyalty, allowing shoppers to accrue and redeem points in any channel. TouchBistro is one of the most used and popular iPad-based POS systems, which caters to both quick service and full-service establishments of any size.</p>

And while the software half of the POS system equation is probably most important, especially in a cloud-based solution, many retail businesses will still require a hardware half.</p>

Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location.
