Retail and gaming POS solution that offers employee access controls, inventory tracking, check splitting, and loyalty cards. Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers. TouchSystems understands that reality and helps people to discover those tools, whether they be self-service kiosks, digital signage or point of sale (POS) terminals.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability.
