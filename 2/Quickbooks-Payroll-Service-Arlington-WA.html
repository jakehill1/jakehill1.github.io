<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>

A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store.
